# Weather Dashboard

[Weather Dashboard](https://emmbra.github.io/homeworkWeek6/index.html)

## Description
Created a Weather Dashboard app with the following features:

* City Search:
    * Provides current weather which includes city name, current date, weather condition icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a color coded UV index.
    * Provides 5-day-forecast which includes the future date, weather condition icon, temperature, and humidity.
    * Adds city searched to Search History.
* Search History:
    * Saves cities searched to local storage.
    * Cities in Search History can be clicked to perform a city search.
    * Search history and local storage can be cleared with Clear History button.


## Technologies

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap CDN
* jQuery CDN
* moment.js CDN
* Open Weather API

## Challenges

In total this project took about 12 hours to build including all the time put into research and trial & error.

Difficulties included:

* Working with APIs for the first time had a learning curve. Targeting and manipulating the data was difficult at times, but I feel like any API request in the future will be easier now that I've worked with the Open Weather API.
